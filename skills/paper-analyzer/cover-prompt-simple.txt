Create a minimalist, Notion-style cover image for an academic paper analyzer tool.

Visual elements:
- An open book or academic paper in the center
- Clean, simple icons floating around it: a clock (representing "5 minutes"), a chart/graph icon, text symbols
- Chinese text "论文速读" (Paper Speed Reading) as the main title
- Chinese subtitle "5分钟精炼分享" (5-Minute Refined Sharing)

Style:
- Minimal, clean Notion aesthetic
- Flat design with no gradients
- Color scheme: Deep gray (#2C2C2C) for text, soft blue (#5B9BD5) accents, off-white background (#F7F7F5)
- Plenty of white space
- 16:9 aspect ratio for GitHub README banner
- Professional but approachable

The overall feel should be clean, modern, and emphasize the "5-minute reading" concept.
